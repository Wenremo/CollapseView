Building damage classifier for coordinating intervention teams to damaged areas in real time. 

Steps:
Core idea: Collapsed building classifier. Extendable to damage intensity classifier. 

# To do:
1) Get a dataset - intact and collapsed/damaged builings - orthogonal view / eagle eye view. 
2) Transform data - split, scale, contrast, rotate, color change. 
3) Use IBM's image ecognition model via API - using generated account key 
4) Train it on building data that was sourced. Can detect multiple buildings? 
5) Assess model's accuracy and improve. 
6) Visualise output on google maps in a flask web server.
